To demonstrate a request flow in a Kubernetes (k8s) setup, let’s walk through a simplified example of how a request from an external user reaches an application running in a Kubernetes cluster. The example will include key components like Ingress, Service, Deployment, and Pods.

### Example Scenario

- **User**: A user wants to access a web application hosted on a Kubernetes cluster.
- **Web Application**: The application is a simple Node.js app running in a Pod within the cluster.
- **Domain**: The user accesses the app via `http://example.com`.
- **Kubernetes Components**:
  - **Ingress**: Manages external access to the services in the cluster.
  - **Service**: Exposes the Pods within the cluster.
  - **Deployment**: Manages the Pods running the application.
  - **Pod**: Runs the containerized Node.js application.

### 1. **Request from User**
   - The user enters `http://example.com` into their browser and sends a request to the application.

### 2. **Ingress**
   - The request first hits the Ingress controller, which is configured to listen for requests on `example.com`.
   - The Ingress controller routes the request based on the rules defined in the Ingress resource.

   **Ingress YAML Example**:
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
   kind: Ingress
   metadata:
     name: web-ingress
     annotations:
       nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /
   spec:
     rules:
     - host: example.com
       http:
         paths:
         - path: /
           pathType: Prefix
           backend:
             service:
               name: web-service
               port:
                 number: 80
   ```

### 3. **Service**
   - The Ingress directs the request to the appropriate Service, which acts as a stable endpoint to access the Pods.
   - The Service is configured with a `ClusterIP` type, meaning it is accessible only within the cluster, but Ingress makes it externally available.

   **Service YAML Example**:
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Service
   metadata:
     name: web-service
   spec:
     selector:
       app: web-app
     ports:
     - protocol: TCP
       port: 80
       targetPort: 8080
   ```

### 4. **Deployment**
   - The Service forwards the request to one of the Pods managed by the Deployment. The Deployment ensures that the desired number of replicas of the application are running.
   - The Deployment uses a selector to match Pods with the label `app: web-app`.

   **Deployment YAML Example**:
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: apps/v1
   kind: Deployment
   metadata:
     name: web-deployment
   spec:
     replicas: 3
     selector:
       matchLabels:
         app: web-app
     template:
       metadata:
         labels:
           app: web-app
       spec:
         containers:
         - name: nodejs-container
           image: node:14
           ports:
           - containerPort: 8080
   ```

### 5. **Pod**
   - The request is finally forwarded to a Pod, where the Node.js application is running.
   - The Pod processes the request, and the application generates a response.

   **Pod Example**:
   - Each Pod running in the cluster has the Node.js application container, which listens on port `8080`.

### 6. **Response to User**
   - The Pod sends the response back through the Service.
   - The Service routes the response back to the Ingress.
   - The Ingress controller sends the response back to the user’s browser.

### **Request Flow Summary**
1. **User** sends a request to `http://example.com`.
2. **Ingress** receives the request and routes it to the **Service**.
3. **Service** forwards the request to one of the **Pods** managed by the **Deployment**.
4. **Pod** processes the request and sends the response back to the user through the **Service** and **Ingress**.

### **Visual Representation**

Here's a basic diagram:

```
+--------+        +-------------+        +-------------+        +-----------+
|  User  | -----> |   Ingress   | -----> |   Service   | -----> |    Pod    |
+--------+        +-------------+        +-------------+        +-----------+
  example.com        web-ingress            web-service            web-app
```

This flow illustrates how Kubernetes components work together to handle a request from an external user and route it through the cluster to the appropriate application pod.
