# Data Engineering

## Flow in Your Example

1. **OLTP Systems (Transactional Databases):**
   - The website uses an OLTP (Online Transaction Processing) system for day-to-day transactions like user registrations, purchases, or activity logs.
   - These systems are optimized for real-time, high-frequency operations (e.g., updating user profiles, processing payments).
   - **Examples:** MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB.

2. **Data Lake (Raw Data Storage):**
   - Over time, the data from the OLTP system is extracted and stored in a data lake. This raw data might include user activity logs, clicks, or sensor data from various sources.
   - The data lake acts as a centralized storage for raw, unprocessed data in its native formats.
   - **Purpose:** It serves as a long-term archive and a foundation for diverse analytics, machine learning, or advanced processing tasks.

3. **Data Warehouse (Processed Data for Analytics):**
   - Data from the lake is cleaned, transformed, and loaded (ETL process) into a data warehouse.
   - The warehouse organizes the data into a structured format, making it ready for slicing, dicing, and querying.
   - **Purpose:** Business intelligence (BI) teams use this data for generating dashboards, KPIs, and reports to drive decision-making.

## How Does Medallion Architecture Fit in This Picture?

The Medallion Architecture, often associated with the Delta Lake framework, fits seamlessly into the workflow you described by organizing data in tiers within the data lake. This structure ensures efficient data processing, governance, and usability as data transitions from raw to refined states.

### What is Medallion Architecture?

The Medallion Architecture organizes data in a layered structure with three main stages:
1. **Bronze Layer (Raw Data):** Stores raw, unprocessed data. (data lake)
2. **Silver Layer (Cleaned Data):** Stores cleaned, structured, and transformed data. (transform)
3. **Gold Layer (Aggregated Data):** Stores highly optimized data for analytics and business intelligence. (data warehouse)

### Medallion Architecture in the Data Pipeline

1. **OLTP Systems (Transactional Data):**
   - Data flows from OLTP systems into the Bronze Layer of the data lake.

2. **Bronze Layer (Raw Data):**
   - This layer stores raw, unprocessed data from the source systems in its native format (e.g., JSON, logs, CSV, etc.).
   - **Example:** Unprocessed transaction logs, user activity data, clickstream logs.

3. **Silver Layer (Cleaned Data):**
   - Data in the Bronze Layer is cleaned, deduplicated, and transformed into a structured format in the Silver Layer.
   - This layer serves as the single source of truth for analysts or downstream processes.
   - **Example:** Transaction data is enriched with user details, and errors in the data are corrected.

4. **Gold Layer (Aggregated Data):**
   - Data in the Silver Layer is aggregated and organized into business-ready datasets for use in analytics, dashboards, or machine learning models.
   - **Example:** Aggregated sales data, customer segmentation insights, or inventory trends.

5. **Data Warehouse Integration:**
   - The Gold Layer feeds into the data warehouse, where slicing and dicing operations occur. The structured format ensures high performance for analytical queries.
   - Alternatively, BI tools like Tableau, Power BI, or Looker can directly access the Gold Layer if the data lake supports fast querying.

## How Does Databricks Lakehouse Platform Fit in the Picture?

The Databricks Lakehouse Platform is a cutting-edge data architecture that unifies the best features of data lakes and data warehouses to create a single platform for all your data needs. It fits into the workflow you described by serving as the backbone for the entire pipeline—storing, processing, and analyzing data seamlessly.

### What is a Lakehouse?

**Lakehouse = Data Lake + Data Warehouse**

1. **Data Lake Characteristics (Bronze Layer):**
   - Stores large volumes of raw, unprocessed, and diverse data types.
   - **Example:** Logs, JSON files, images, videos, and sensor data.
   - **Purpose:** Provides cost-efficient and scalable storage.

2. **Data Warehouse Characteristics (Gold Layer):**
   - Stores clean, structured, and aggregated data for business analytics.
   - **Purpose:** Enables fast, reliable querying and BI operations.

3. **Transformations (Silver Layer):**
   - The Silver Layer bridges the gap between raw data (data lake) and refined data (data warehouse).
   - **Example:** Deduplication, cleaning, and enriching data.

### What Makes a Lakehouse Special?

- **Unified Storage and Processing:**
   - The Lakehouse architecture eliminates the need for separate systems (like a traditional data lake and data warehouse).
- **ACID Transactions:** Ensures data reliability and consistency, a feature of data warehouses.
- **Scalability:** Handles large-scale, unstructured data like a data lake.
- **Performance:** Provides optimized query performance like a data warehouse.

## How Databricks Lakehouse Fits in Your Pipeline

1. **Data Ingestion:**
   - Data from OLTP systems is ingested directly into the Bronze Layer of the Delta Lake using Databricks.
   - Handles both batch ingestion and real-time streaming.

2. **Bronze Layer (Raw Data):**
   - Stores raw, unprocessed data in cloud object storage (e.g., AWS S3).
   - ACID transactions ensure data reliability.

3. **Silver Layer (Cleaned Data):**
   - Data engineers use Databricks to clean, transform, and deduplicate data.
   - Structured datasets are prepared for downstream analytics and machine learning.

4. **Gold Layer (Business-Ready Data):**
   - Aggregated, refined data is stored here for BI tools (e.g., Tableau, Power BI).
   - Supports slicing and dicing operations directly via SQL queries.

5. **Advanced Analytics and ML:**
   - Data scientists use the cleaned data for ML models within Databricks.
   - The platform integrates seamlessly with tools like MLflow for model development and deployment.

6. **Real-Time Analytics:**
   - Streaming capabilities allow for real-time dashboards and alerts.
