# Data Engineering

## Flow in Your Example

1. **OLTP Systems (Transactional Databases):**

   - The website uses an OLTP (Online Transaction Processing) system for day-to-day transactions like user registrations, purchases, or activity logs.
   - These systems are optimized for real-time, high-frequency operations (e.g., updating user profiles, processing payments).
   - **Examples:** MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB.

2. **Data Lake (Raw Data Storage):**

   - Over time, the data from the OLTP system is extracted and stored in a data lake. This raw data might include user activity logs, clicks, or sensor data from various sources.
   - The data lake acts as a centralized storage for raw, unprocessed data in its native formats.
   - **Purpose:** It serves as a long-term archive and a foundation for diverse analytics, machine learning, or advanced processing tasks.

3. **Data Warehouse (Processed Data for Analytics):**
   - Data from the lake is cleaned, transformed, and loaded (ETL process) into a data warehouse.
   - The warehouse organizes the data into a structured format, making it ready for slicing, dicing, and querying.
   - **Purpose:** Business intelligence (BI) teams use this data for generating dashboards, KPIs, and reports to drive decision-making.

## How Does Medallion Architecture Fit in This Picture?

The Medallion Architecture, often associated with the Delta Lake framework, fits seamlessly into the workflow you described by organizing data in tiers within the data lake. This structure ensures efficient data processing, governance, and usability as data transitions from raw to refined states.

### What is Medallion Architecture?

The Medallion Architecture organizes data in a layered structure with three main stages:

1. **Bronze Layer (Raw Data):** Stores raw, unprocessed data. (data lake)
2. **Silver Layer (Cleaned Data):** Stores cleaned, structured, and transformed data. (transform)
3. **Gold Layer (Aggregated Data):** Stores highly optimized data for analytics and business intelligence. (data warehouse)

### Medallion Architecture in the Data Pipeline

1. **OLTP Systems (Transactional Data):**

   - Data flows from OLTP systems into the Bronze Layer of the data lake.

2. **Bronze Layer (Raw Data):**

   - This layer stores raw, unprocessed data from the source systems in its native format (e.g., JSON, logs, CSV, etc.).
   - **Example:** Unprocessed transaction logs, user activity data, clickstream logs.

3. **Silver Layer (Cleaned Data):**

   - Data in the Bronze Layer is cleaned, deduplicated, and transformed into a structured format in the Silver Layer.
   - This layer serves as the single source of truth for analysts or downstream processes.
   - **Example:** Transaction data is enriched with user details, and errors in the data are corrected.

4. **Gold Layer (Aggregated Data):**

   - Data in the Silver Layer is aggregated and organized into business-ready datasets for use in analytics, dashboards, or machine learning models.
   - **Example:** Aggregated sales data, customer segmentation insights, or inventory trends.

5. **Data Warehouse Integration:**
   - The Gold Layer feeds into the data warehouse, where slicing and dicing operations occur. The structured format ensures high performance for analytical queries.
   - Alternatively, BI tools like Tableau, Power BI, or Looker can directly access the Gold Layer if the data lake supports fast querying.

| ------------------------ | ----------- | ------------ |
| ACID Transactions        | No          | Yes          |
| Schema Evolution         | Limited     | Full Support |
| Time Travel              | No          | Yes          |
| Merge Operations         | No          | Yes          |
| Performance Optimization | Basic       | Advanced     |

I'll explain the concept of transaction logs and how they help provide ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties in a comprehensive markdown format.

# Transaction Logs in DataBricks

## What are Transaction Logs?

A transaction log is a sequential record of all database modifications, capturing every change made to the database in a detailed, chronological manner. It serves as a critical mechanism for ensuring data integrity and recovering from system failures.

## Purpose of Transaction Logs

Transaction logs are essential for:

- Maintaining database reliability
- Providing a mechanism for recovery
- Implementing ACID properties
- Enabling point-in-time recovery

## Benefits of Transaction Logs

1. **Data Recovery**: Reconstruct database after crashes
2. **Audit Trail**: Track all database modifications
3. **Performance Optimization**: Separate logging from actual data modification
4. **Replication**: Sync databases by replaying transaction logs

## Challenges and Considerations

- Log file size management
- Performance overhead
- Efficient log storage and retrieval
- Balancing between detailed logging and system performance

> Transaction logs are fundamental to maintaining data integrity in database systems. By providing a robust mechanism to track, validate, and recover database operations, they ensure that the ACID properties are consistently maintained.

## Conclusion

Delta Tables represent a significant advancement in data lake technology, providing reliability, performance, and flexibility that traditional file formats cannot match. They are particularly powerful in Databricks' unified analytics platform, enabling more sophisticated and reliable data engineering and analytics workflows.

> Delta Tables essentially add a "database-like" layer of reliability and transactional capabilities on top of data lake storage, bridging the gap between traditional databases and big data analytics platforms. So all this coz its not oltp ie no db so normal sql wont work so no acid properties that why delta table as we are fetching from the data lake not the db and we need db like features such as ACID property

    extra_configs = {"<configuration>": "<value>"}
)
```

### Working with Default Database

```python
# Create table in default database
spark.sql("""
    CREATE TABLE default.employees (
        id INT,
        name STRING,
        department STRING
    )
""")

# Query default database
spark.sql("SHOW TABLES IN default")
```

### Database and Table Management

```python
# Create custom database
spark.sql("CREATE DATABASE sales_db")

# Create table in custom database
spark.sql("""
    CREATE TABLE sales_db.sales_data (
        sale_date DATE,
        product STRING,
        amount DECIMAL(10,2)
    )
""")
```

## Best Practices

- Use `/dbfs/mnt/` for external storage mounting
- Organize data by environment (raw, processed, etc.)
- Use custom databases for logical data separation
- Implement proper access controls
- Regularly clean up `/dbfs/tmp/` directory

## Key Differences

- **DBFS**: File system abstraction

# Views in Databricks: Types and Characteristics

## What is a View?

- A **logical** representation of a query
- Does not store data physically
- Provides a virtual table based on the result of a SELECT statement
- Acts like a saved query that can be referenced like a table

## Types of Views

### 1. Temporary Views

- **Scope**: Exists only within a single Spark session
- Disappears when the session ends
- Useful for ad-hoc analysis

```python
# Create Temporary View
df.createOrReplaceTempView("temp_employee_view")

# Query Temporary View
spark.sql("SELECT * FROM temp_employee_view WHERE department = 'Sales'")
```

### 2. Global Temporary Views

- **Scope**: Accessible across multiple Spark sessions
- Stored in the global temp database
- Persists until the Spark application is terminated

```python
# Create Global Temporary View
df.createOrReplaceGlobalTempView("global_employee_view")

# Query Global Temporary View
spark.sql("SELECT * FROM global_temp.global_employee_view")
```

### 3. Persistent Views (Stored Views)

- **Scope**: Permanently stored in the Hive metastore
- Survives across Spark sessions
- Can be used like permanent tables

```python
# Create Persistent View
spark.sql("""
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW hr_view AS
SELECT id, name, department
FROM employees
WHERE department = 'HR'
""")
```

## Is a View a Screenshot?

### No, Not Exactly

- **Not a Static Snapshot**
  - Always reflects the current state of underlying tables
  - Dynamically generates results when queried
  - Data changes in source tables are immediately reflected

### View vs. Materialized View

| Aspect         | Regular View          | Materialized View         |
| -------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Data Storage   | No physical storage   | Physically stored results |
| Performance    | Recomputes each query | Precomputed, faster query |
| Data Freshness | Always current        | Needs periodic refresh    |

## View Characteristics

- Read-only by default
- Can combine multiple tables
- Supports complex transformations
- Provides abstraction and security
- Reduces query complexity

## Views are dynamic, query-based representations that provide flexibility in data access and query design, unlike a static screenshot of data.

# Delta Lake Advanced Concepts: Time Travel, Compaction, Vacuum, and Indexing

## Time Travel in Delta Lake

### Concept

- Ability to access previous versions of a Delta table
- Maintains historical snapshots of data
- Enables point-in-time querying and recovery

### Key Characteristics

```python
# Accessing previous versions of a table
# By version number
df = spark.read.format("delta").option("versionAsOf", 0).load("/path/to/delta/table")

# By timestamp
df = spark.read.format("delta").option("timestampAsOf", "2024-01-01 10:00:00").load("/path/to/delta/table")
```

### Version History

- Each write operation creates a new table version
- Transaction log tracks all modifications
- Configurable history retention

## File Compaction (Optimize)

### Small File Problem

- Multiple small files reduce query performance
- Increases overhead in file management
- Impacts storage efficiency

### Compaction Process

```python
# Compact and optimize Delta table
from delta.tables import DeltaTable

deltaTable = DeltaTable.forPath(spark, "/path/to/delta/table")

# Compact files and create Z-Order index
deltaTable.optimize().executeCompaction()

# Specific column Z-Ordering
deltaTable.optimize().executeZOrderBy("id", "date")
```

### Optimization Strategies

- Combines small files into larger ones
- Improves read performance
- Reduces storage overhead
- Supports Z-Ordering for multi-dimensional indexing

## Vacuum Operation

### Purpose

- Removes old files no longer referenced in the table
- Prevents accumulation of unnecessary files
- Manages storage space

### Implementation

```python
# Vacuum operation
deltaTable.vacuum()  # Default 7 days retention

# Custom retention period (hours)
deltaTable.vacuum(168)  # 7 days
```

### Key Considerations

- Prevents time travel beyond retention period
- Configurable retention window
- Helps manage storage costs

## Indexing in Delta Lake

### Z-Ordering (Multi-Dimensional Clustering)

- Co-locates related data
- Improves query performance
- Reduces data scanning

```python
# Z-Ordering example
deltaTable.optimize().executeZOrderBy("country", "state")
```

### Clustering Benefits

- Reduces I/O
- Speeds up range and equality queries
- Works best with high-cardinality columns

## Comprehensive Example

```python
from delta.tables import DeltaTable
from pyspark.sql.functions import col

# Create Delta Table
spark.createDataFrame(...).write.format("delta").save("/path/to/table")

# Delta Table Operations
deltaTable = DeltaTable.forPath(spark, "/path/to/table")

# 1. Optimize and Z-Order
deltaTable.optimize().executeZOrderBy("id", "date")

# 2. Vacuum old files
deltaTable.vacuum(168)  # 7 days retention

# 3. Time Travel Query
old_version = spark.read.format("delta") \
    .option("versionAsOf", 1) \
    .load("/path/to/table")
```

## Performance Impact

| Operation   | Performance | Storage | Use Case            |
| ----------- | ----------- | ------- | ------------------- |
| Time Travel | Moderate    | High    | Historical Analysis |
| Compaction  | High        | Medium  | Query Performance   |
| Vacuum      | Low         | High    | Storage Management  |
| Z-Ordering  | High        | Low     | Query Optimization  |

# Delta Lake Table Creation and Management Techniques

## Create Table As Select (CTAS) vs Traditional Create Table

### CTAS (Create Table As Select)

```sql
-- CTAS Example
CREATE TABLE employees_backup
AS SELECT * FROM employees
```

### Traditional Create Table

```sql
-- Traditional Method
CREATE TABLE employees_new (
    id INT,
    name STRING,
    department STRING
) USING DELTA
```

## Comparison of CTAS and Traditional Create Table

| Aspect           | CTAS                      | Traditional Create Table   |
| ---------------- | ------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Data Population  | Immediate data copy       | Schema defined, no data    |
| Schema Inference | Automatic from source     | Manual schema definition   |
| Performance      | Faster for large datasets | More control over schema   |
| Flexibility      | Limited customization     | More configuration options |

## Table Constraints in Delta Lake

### Define Constraints

```sql
-- NOT NULL Constraint
CREATE TABLE employees (
    id INT NOT NULL,
    name STRING NOT NULL,
    salary DECIMAL(10,2) CHECK (salary > 0)
) USING DELTA

-- Adding Constraints to Existing Table
ALTER TABLE employees
ADD CONSTRAINT positive_salary CHECK (salary > 0)
```

### Constraint Types

1. **NOT NULL**
2. **CHECK** constraints
3. **UNIQUE** constraints
4. **Primary Key** constraints

## Table Cloning in Delta Lake

### Shallow Clone

```python
# Shallow Clone
spark.sql("""
CREATE TABLE employees_clone
CLONE employees
""")
```

### Deep Clone

```python
# Deep Clone
spark.sql("""
CREATE TABLE employees_full_clone
CLONE employees DEEP
""")
```

## Shallow vs Deep Clone: Detailed Comparison

### Shallow Clone

- **Characteristics**
  - Creates metadata link to original table
  - No data copied
  - Lightweight
  - Shares underlying data files
  - Changes in original affect clone

### Deep Clone

- **Characteristics**
  - Complete independent copy of data
  - Full data files copied
  - Separate storage
  - Isolated from original table
  - No dependency on source table

## Comprehensive Example

```python
from delta.tables import DeltaTable

# Original Table
spark.sql("""
CREATE TABLE sales (
    sale_id INT,
    product STRING,
    amount DECIMAL(10,2),
    sale_date DATE
) USING DELTA
""")

# Add Constraints
spark.sql("""
ALTER TABLE sales
ADD CONSTRAINT positive_amount CHECK (amount > 0)
""")

# CTAS with Filtering
spark.sql("""
CREATE TABLE high_value_sales
AS SELECT * FROM sales
WHERE amount > 1000
""")

# Cloning
# Shallow Clone
spark.sql("CREATE TABLE sales_shallow_clone CLONE sales")

# Deep Clone
spark.sql("CREATE TABLE sales_deep_clone CLONE sales DEEP")
```

## Best Practices

### Table Creation

- Use CTAS for quick data copying
- Define constraints early
- Leverage schema evolution

# CTAS vs CRAS in Spark/Databricks

## CTAS (Create Table As Select)

- **Definition**: Creates a new table by selecting data from an existing table or query
- **Syntax**:
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE new_table AS
  SELECT * FROM source_table;
  ```
- **Characteristics**:
  - Creates a new table based on a SELECT query
  - Copies data and schema from the source
  - Cannot be used if the table already exists
  - Creates a managed table by default

## CRAS (Create or Replace Table As Select)

- **Definition**: Creates a new table or replaces an existing table with data from a SELECT query
- **Syntax**:
  ```sql
  CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE new_table AS
  SELECT * FROM source_table;
  ```
- **Characteristics**:
  - Can create a new table or replace an existing one
  - Provides more flexibility than CTAS
  - Removes need to drop and recreate table

## Limitations of CRAS for CSV Imports

### Primary Limitations:

1. **No Direct Option Setting**
   - Cannot specify CSV-specific options
   - Challenging for complex CSV imports
   - Limited control over:
     - Delimiter
     - Header handling
     - Null value representation
     - Date/timestamp formats

### Solution: Using Temporary View

```python
# Python/PySpark Solution
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession

# Create SparkSession
spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("CSV Import Solution").getOrCreate()

# Read CSV with specific options
df = spark.read.format("csv") \
    .option("header", "true") \
    .option("delimiter", ",") \
    .option("inferSchema", "true") \
    .option("nullValue", "NA") \
    .load("/path/to/your/file.csv")

# Create Temporary View
df.createOrReplaceTempView("temp_csv_table")

# CRAS using the Temporary View
spark.sql("""
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE final_table AS
SELECT * FROM temp_csv_table
""")
```

### Alternative SQL Approach:

```sql
-- Create Temporary View with Options
CREATE OR REPLACE TEMPORARY VIEW temp_csv_table
USING csv
OPTIONS (
    path "/path/to/your/file.csv",
    header "true",
    delimiter ",",
    inferSchema "true",
    nullValue "NA"
)

-- CRAS from Temporary View
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE final_table AS
SELECT * FROM temp_csv_table
```

## Key Advantages of Temp View Approach

1. **Full Control over Import Options**
2. **Flexible CSV Parsing**
3. **Ability to Transform Data During Import**
4. **Works with CRAS**
5. **Handles Complex CSV Scenarios**

## Practical Considerations

- Temporary views exist only for the duration of the Spark session
- Ideal for one-time imports or complex data transformations
- Provides maximum flexibility in data ingestion

### When to Use

- Complex CSV files with non-standard formats
- Need for precise data type inference
- Handling null values, special delimiters
- Transforming data during import

### Performance Note

- Creating a temporary view adds a small overhead
- For very large files, consider direct DataFrame reading and writing

## Example with Advanced Options

```python
df = spark.read.format("csv") \
    .option("header", "true") \
    .option("delimiter", "|") \
    .option("dateFormat", "yyyy-MM-dd") \
    .option("timestampFormat", "yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss") \
    .option("mode", "FAILFAST") \
    .option("encoding", "UTF-8") \
    .load("/path/to/complex/file.csv")

df.createOrReplaceTempView("processed_csv")

spark.sql("""
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE final_processed_table AS
SELECT
    col1,
    CAST(date_column AS DATE) AS formatted_date,
    CAST(numeric_column AS DECIMAL(10,2)) AS converted_numeric
FROM processed_csv
""")
```

# Querying Files Directly in Databricks

## 1. File Formats Supported

- Parquet
- CSV
- JSON
- ORC
- Avro
- Text
- Delta
- XML (with additional libraries)

## 2. Basic File Querying Methods

### A. SQL Syntax

```sql
-- Direct File Query
SELECT * FROM parquet.`/path/to/file/directory`

-- CSV with Options
SELECT * FROM csv.`/path/to/csv/`
OPTIONS (
    header "true",
    inferSchema "true"
)
```

### B. PySpark DataFrame Approach

```python
# Read File
df = spark.read.format("parquet").load("/path/to/parquet/files")

# Create Temporary View
df.createOrReplaceTempView("my_file_table")

# Query Temporary View
spark.sql("SELECT * FROM my_file_table")
```

## 3. Advanced File Querying Techniques

### A. Multiple File Formats in Single Query

```sql
SELECT
    filename,  -- Captures source filename
    *
FROM parquet.`/path/to/parquet/directory`
```

### B. Wildcard File Selection

```sql
-- Query specific file patterns
SELECT * FROM parquet.`/path/to/files/year=2024/month=*/`
```

## 4. File Metadata and Filtering

### A. Accessing File Metadata

```sql
SELECT
    input_file_name(),  -- Full file path
    input_file_block_start(),  -- Block start position
    *
FROM parquet.`/path/to/files`
```

### B. Partition Pruning

```sql
-- Efficient querying of partitioned data
SELECT * FROM parquet.`/path/to/partitioned/data/`
WHERE year = 2024 AND month = 'January'
```

## 5. Complex File Querying Scenarios

### A. Schema Inference and Override

```python
# Explicit Schema Definition
from pyspark.sql.types import StructType, StructField, StringType, IntegerType

custom_schema = StructType([
    StructField("name", StringType(), True),
    StructField("age", IntegerType(), True)
])

df = spark.read.format("csv") \
    .schema(custom_schema) \
    .option("header", "true") \
    .load("/path/to/csv/")
```

### B. Handling Different Delimiters

```sql
SELECT * FROM csv.`/path/to/pipe/delimited/files`
OPTIONS (
    sep "|",
    header "true"
)
```

## 6. Performance Considerations

### Best Practices

- Use columnar formats (Parquet, Delta)
- Implement partition pruning
- Leverage file metadata filtering
- Avoid reading entire large directories

### Example Optimized Query

```sql
SELECT
    department,
    AVG(salary) as avg_salary
FROM parquet.`/path/to/employee/data/`
WHERE
    year = 2024 AND  -- Partition filter
    salary > 50000   -- Push-down predicate
GROUP BY department
```

## 7. Error Handling and Modes

### Reading Modes

```python
# Different parsing modes
df = spark.read.format("csv")
    .option("mode", "PERMISSIVE")  # Default, continues reading
    .option("mode", "DROPMALFORMED")  # Drops bad records
    .option("mode", "FAILFAST")  # Stops on first error
    .load("/path/to/files")
```

## 8. Cloud Storage Integration

```python
# Direct S3 Querying
df = spark.read.parquet("s3a://bucket/path/")

# Azure Blob/ADLS
df = spark.read.parquet("abfs://container@account.dfs.core.windows.net/path")

# GCS
df = spark.read.parquet("gs://bucket/path")
```

## Pro Tips

- Always use columnar formats for analytical workloads
- Implement partition strategies
- Use file-level metadata for advanced filtering
- Leverage Databricks' optimized file reading capabilities

## Common Gotchas

- Large directories can cause performance issues
- Inconsistent schemas across files
- Handling of null/missing values
- Performance overhead with complex transformations

# Writing into Tables

## Comprehensive Comparison of Data Insertion Methods

### 1. CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE (CRAS)

```sql
-- Completely replaces the entire table
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE target_table AS
SELECT * FROM source_table
```

**Characteristics:**

- Creates the table if it doesn't exist
- Completely overwrites the table if it exists
- Modifies table schema
- Drops and recreates the entire table
- Loses existing table properties and constraints

**Use Cases:**

- Initial data loading
- Completely refreshing a table
- When schema changes are acceptable

### 2. INSERT OVERWRITE

```sql
-- Overwrites existing data matching the current table schema
INSERT OVERWRITE TABLE target_table
SELECT * FROM source_table
```

**Characteristics:**

- Requires table to already exist
- Replaces only data matching current table schema
- Preserves table schema and properties
- More conservative approach
- Safer for maintaining table structure

**Use Cases:**

- Updating existing tables
- Maintaining consistent table schema
- Partial data replacement

### 3. INSERT INTO

```sql
-- Appends new records to the existing table
INSERT INTO TABLE target_table
SELECT * FROM source_table
```

**Characteristics:**

- Adds new records to the existing table
- Does not remove existing data
- High risk of data duplication
- No built-in deduplication
- Increases table size with each operation

**Risks:**

- Potential duplicate records
- No natural way to handle updates
- Requires manual deduplication strategies

### 4. MERGE INTO

```sql
-- Comprehensive upsert operation
MERGE INTO target_table t
USING source_table s
ON t.id = s.id
WHEN MATCHED THEN UPDATE SET *
WHEN NOT MATCHED THEN INSERT *
```

**Characteristics:**

- Most sophisticated data synchronization method
- Handles updates, inserts, and deletes in single operation
- Provides fine-grained control
- Supports complex matching conditions
- Atomically handles multiple data change scenarios

**Advantages:**

- Prevents duplicate records
- Supports conditional updates
- Handles various data change scenarios
- Most flexible and safe approach

| Performance     | High | Moderate         | Low         | Moderate   |

## Practical Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Daily Data Load

```sql
-- Merge approach for daily updates
MERGE INTO sales_table t
USING daily_sales s
ON t.sale_id = s.sale_id
WHEN MATCHED THEN
    UPDATE SET
        t.amount = s.amount,
        t.timestamp = s.timestamp
WHEN NOT MATCHED THEN
    INSERT *
```

### Scenario 2: Incremental Data Load

```python
# PySpark approach for incremental loading
def incremental_load(source_df, target_table):
    source_df.createOrReplaceTempView("source_data")

    spark.sql(f"""
    MERGE INTO {target_table} t
    USING source_data s
    ON t.unique_key = s.unique_key
    WHEN MATCHED THEN UPDATE SET *
    WHEN NOT MATCHED THEN INSERT *
    """)
```

## Best Practices

1. **Use MERGE for Complex Scenarios**

   - Prefer MERGE for most data synchronization tasks
   - Provides most robust error handling

2. **CRAS for Initial/Complete Refreshes**

   - Ideal for periodic complete table refreshes
   - Use when schema changes are expected

3. **Insert Overwrite for Consistent Schemas**

   - When you want to replace data without changing structure
   - Safer than complete table replacement

4. **Avoid Insert Into for Critical Data**
   - Prone to duplication
   - Requires additional deduplication logic

## Performance Considerations

- MERGE is computationally more expensive
- Insert Overwrite is typically faster than MERGE
- CRAS has lowest overhead for complete replacements

## Recommendation Matrix

- **Small, Changing Datasets**: MERGE
- **Static, Periodic Refreshes**: CRAS
- **Append-Only Logs**: Insert Into
- **Consistent Schema Updates**: Insert Overwrite

## Gotchas and Warnings

- Always test data manipulation strategies
- Consider data volume and update frequency
- Implement proper error handling
- Monitor performance impacts
- Use appropriate primary/unique keys in MERGE operations
