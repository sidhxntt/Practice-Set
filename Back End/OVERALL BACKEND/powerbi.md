# POWERBI
## WORKFLOW
To get data into Power BI, you use the Power BI Desktop application to connect to data sources, transform the data, and build reports. Here’s a step-by-step guide to doing it properly:

**Step 1: Launch Power BI Desktop**

1.	Open Power BI Desktop.
2.	You will land on the Home screen.

**Step 2: Connect to a Data Source**

1.	Go to the Home Tab:
	-	Click Get Data.
	- A dropdown menu appears with various data source options.
2.	Choose the Data Source:
	-	Common options include:
	-	Excel: For files in .xlsx or .xls format.
	-	SQL Server: For databases.
	-	Web: For online data (e.g., APIs, web tables).
	-	Text/CSV: For .csv or .txt files.
	-	Other: SharePoint, Azure, Oracle, etc.
	-	Select the source you want to connect to.
3.	Provide Connection Details:
	-	For files: Browse and select the file.
	-	For databases: Enter server name, database name, and authentication details (e.g., username/password).

**Step 3: Preview and Load Data**

1.	Preview Data:
	-	After connecting, Power BI displays a preview of the data.
	-	This step ensures you are importing the correct table, query, or file.
2.	Load or Transform:
	-	Load: Imports the data as-is into Power BI.
	-	Transform Data: Opens Power Query Editor for cleaning and shaping the data.

**Step 4: Transform Data in Power Query (Optional)**

1.	Clean the Data:
	-	Remove unnecessary columns.
	-	Filter rows (e.g., exclude null values or unwanted data).
	-	Rename columns to make them meaningful.
2.	Shape the Data:
	-	Split or merge columns.
	-	Add calculated columns or custom formulas.
	-	Combine data from multiple sources (e.g., merges, appends).
3.	Apply and Close:
	•	After transformations, click Close & Apply to load the cleaned data into Power BI.

**Step 5: Model the Data**

1.	Check Relationships:
	-	Navigate to the Model View to see how tables are related.
	-	Power BI auto-detects relationships but allows manual adjustments.
2.	Create Measures and Calculated Columns:
	-	Use DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) for advanced calculations like totals, averages, or custom KPIs.

**Step 6: Visualize the Data**

1.	Switch to Report View:
	-	Add visuals like charts, tables, maps, and slicers to your report.
2.	Drag Fields into Visuals:
	-	Drag fields from the Fields pane onto visuals in the canvas.
	-	Use fields for Axis, Values, or Filters.

**Step 7: Publish the Report**

1.	Save Your Work:
	-	Save the report as a .pbix file.
2.	Publish to Power BI Service (Optional):
	-	Share the report online by publishing it to the Power BI service.
	-	Go to File > Publish > Publish to Power BI.

**Common Data Sources Supported in Power BI**

-	File-Based:
-	Excel, CSV, Text, XML, JSON.
-	Database-Based:
-	SQL Server, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, etc.
-	Cloud-Based:
-	Azure, Google Analytics, Salesforce, Dynamics 365, etc.
-	Web-Based:
-	APIs, web pages.

## Query Diagnostics

Query Diagnostics in Power BI is a feature that helps you analyze and troubleshoot the performance and behavior of your queries in Power Query.
Query Diagnostics in Power BI is a feature that helps you analyze and troubleshoot the performance and behavior of your queries in Power Query. It provides detailed insights into how queries are processed, which can help identify bottlenecks or inefficiencies in your data transformations.

Why Use Query Diagnostics?

1.	**Understand Performance Issues**:
	•	Identify steps that consume the most time during query execution.
2.	**Monitor Query Folding**:
	•	Check if transformations are being folded into a single query or processed locally.
3.	**Debug Issues**:
	•	Pinpoint errors or unexpected results in your queries.
4.	**Optimize Queries**:
	•	Use diagnostics to make transformations more efficient by reducing unnecessary operations.
