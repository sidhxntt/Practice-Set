In a many-to-many (M-M) relationship, an intermediary table (also known as a join table or junction table) is necessary to effectively model the relationship between two entities because of the way databases handle associations.

### Why an Intermediary Table is Needed:

1. **Direct M-M Relationships**:
   - In a relational database, a direct many-to-many relationship means that multiple records in one table can be associated with multiple records in another table. For example, a `User` can have many `Roles`, and each `Role` can belong to many `Users`.
   - Relational databases don't have a built-in way to directly link many records in one table to many records in another table. Instead, they use a third table (intermediary table) to store the associations.

2. **Intermediary Table Structure**:
   - The intermediary table typically has foreign keys referencing the primary keys of the two tables it links.
   - For example, a `UserRoles` table might contain `userId` and `roleId` as foreign keys that reference the `User` and `Role` tables, respectively. Each row in `UserRoles` represents a link between one user and one role.

3. **Flexibility and Scalability**:
   - Using an intermediary table provides flexibility. You can store additional information about the relationship itself in this table (e.g., `createdAt`, `assignedBy`, etc.).
   - This structure also scales better because it keeps the database normalized, reducing redundancy and ensuring data integrity.

### Example:

Let's consider a many-to-many relationship between `User` and `Role`:

- **User Table**:
  - `id`: Primary key
  - `username`
  - `email`

- **Role Table**:
  - `id`: Primary key
  - `roleName`

- **UserRoles (Intermediary) Table**:
  - `userId`: Foreign key referencing `User.id`
  - `roleId`: Foreign key referencing `Role.id`

In this setup, the `UserRoles` table records which users have which roles, allowing a user to have multiple roles and each role to be assigned to multiple users.

### Without an Intermediary Table:

If you tried to manage a many-to-many relationship directly without an intermediary table, you would encounter several issues:
- **Data Redundancy**: You might end up duplicating data across tables.
- **Scalability Problems**: Managing the relationships becomes more complex as the data grows.
- **Limited Flexibility**: Adding extra information about the relationship itself (e.g., timestamps or additional attributes) would be challenging.

### Conclusion:

The intermediary table is essential because it allows for an efficient, flexible, and scalable way to represent many-to-many relationships in a relational database.
