Ideally producer should be in server 1 & consumer/worker should be in another server (server 2) thereby reducing load of the app server and implement ease of scaling for indiviual serivces hence creating a micro-service architecture.
But for learning pupose we have kept one server only in real world this is not applied as it fails the purpose of reducing the load on app server.
