# Session vs JWT for Auth

## üß† Core Concept

|                | **Session-Based Auth**                                | **JWT (Token-Based Auth)**                                  |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| Storage        | Session stored **server-side**                        | JWT stored **client-side** (usually in localStorage or cookie) |
| Identifier     | Stores a **session ID** in cookie                     | Stores a **token** (self-contained) in cookie or header        |

## üîÑ Flow Comparison

### üîê Session-Based Auth

1. **Login**:
   - User logs in with credentials.
   - Server verifies and **creates a session** (unique ID + user data in memory/database).
   - Session ID is sent to client via **HTTP-only cookie**.

2. **On subsequent requests**:
   - Client sends the cookie.
   - Server reads the session ID, retrieves user info from storage, and validates.

3. **Logout**:
   - Server deletes session from storage.
   - Session ID becomes invalid.

### ü™ô JWT Auth

1. **Login**:
   - User logs in with credentials.
   - Server generates a **JWT** (signed with secret/private key) containing user data or claims.
   - JWT is sent to client (often stored in `localStorage` or HTTP-only cookie).

2. **On subsequent requests**:
   - Client sends the JWT in the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header.
   - Server **verifies the signature**, decodes token, and trusts its claims (e.g., user ID, role).

3. **Logout**:
   - Client deletes the token.
   - No way for server to invalidate token unless you use a blacklist or short expiry.

## üßæ Pros & Cons

### ‚úÖ Session-Based

**Pros**:

- Server can **invalidate** sessions easily.
- Easier to control/expire sessions.

**Cons**:

- Requires **server-side storage** (DB or memory) ‚Üí can affect scalability.
- Doesn't scale as easily for distributed systems without shared storage.

### ‚úÖ JWT-Based

**Pros**:

- **Stateless** ‚Äî no need to store session server-side.
- Scales well in **microservices** / distributed systems.
- Can include extra data (claims) inside token.

**Cons**:

- Harder to **revoke/invalidate** tokens.
- If token is **stolen**, attacker has access until expiry.
- Token bloat (includes all claims every time).

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Notes

- Always use **HTTPS**.
- With JWTs, prefer **HTTP-only secure cookies** for storage (avoid localStorage for XSS risk).
- JWTs should have **short expiration** and consider refresh token flows.

## üöÄ When to Use What?

| Use Case                                  | Prefer                     |
|-------------------------------------------|----------------------------|
| Traditional web apps with a backend       | Session-based              |
| SPAs / mobile apps with APIs              | JWT-based                  |
| High scalability / stateless microservices | JWT-based                  |
| Sensitive apps needing control over sessions | Session-based or JWT + blacklist |

## Analogy

| **Concept**             | **Session-Based Auth**                                                                 | **JWT Auth**                                                                          |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Analogy**             | **Guest list at the door**                                                              | **Wristband that proves you paid**                                                     |
| **How it works**        | You tell the bouncer your name ‚Üí they check it in the **guest list** (on the server).  | You get a **wristband** at the entrance with all your info encoded in it (the token). |
| **Where info is stored**| The club keeps the guest list at the door (central place).                             | The wristband **contains your info** (user ID, access level) directly.                |
| **Entry check**         | Bouncer checks the list each time you come back.                                       | Bouncer looks at your wristband ‚Äî if it‚Äôs valid, you‚Äôre in.                           |
| **Scalability**         | Every club entrance needs access to the same guest list.                               | No list needed ‚Äî any bouncer can validate the wristband.                              |
| **Revoking access**     | Club can just cross your name off the list.                                            | You‚Äôd have to **invalidate the wristband** somehow (harder unless it expires).        |
| **Security risk**       | Someone steals your name and convinces bouncer (session hijacking).                    | Someone steals your wristband and uses it (token theft).                              |
| **Control**             | Club controls everything centrally.                                                    | You‚Äôre trusted to carry your own proof (token).                                       |
