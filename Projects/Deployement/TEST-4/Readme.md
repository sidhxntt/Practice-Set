# ECS & ECR
Deploying a containerized full-stack application (Next.js frontend and Express backend) on AWS involves a series of detailed steps, from containerization to setting up infrastructure on AWS. Here's an in-depth guide to each step:

### **1. Prepare Your Containers**

#### **1.1. Dockerize the Next.js Frontend**
- **Create a `Dockerfile` for the Frontend:**
  - Your `Dockerfile` for Next.js might look something like this:
    ```Dockerfile
    # Stage 1: Build the React application
    FROM node:18-alpine AS builder
    WORKDIR /app
    COPY package.json yarn.lock ./
    RUN yarn install --frozen-lockfile
    COPY . .
    RUN yarn build

    # Stage 2: Serve the application with Next.js server
    FROM node:18-alpine
    WORKDIR /app
    COPY --from=builder /app ./
    EXPOSE 3000
    CMD ["yarn", "start"]
    ```
  - **Explanation:**
    - **Stage 1**: Builds the application.
    - **Stage 2**: Serves the built application using the Next.js server.

#### **1.2. Dockerize the Express Backend**
- **Create a `Dockerfile` for the Backend:**
  - Your `Dockerfile` for Express might look like this:
    ```Dockerfile
    FROM node:18-alpine
    WORKDIR /app
    COPY package.json yarn.lock ./
    RUN yarn install --frozen-lockfile
    COPY . .
    EXPOSE 4000
    CMD ["node", "index.js"]
    ```
  - **Explanation:**
    - This Dockerfile installs dependencies and starts the Express server.

#### **1.3. Test Locally with Docker Compose**
- **Create a `docker-compose.yml` File**:
  - Use Docker Compose to manage both containers together.
    ```yaml
    version: '3'
    services:
      frontend:
        build: ./frontend
        ports:
          - "3000:3000"
      backend:
        build: ./backend
        ports:
          - "4000:4000"
        environment:
          - NODE_ENV=production
    ```
  - **Run the Compose File**:
    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```
  - **Test Your Application**:
    - Ensure that both the frontend and backend are working correctly on your local machine.

### **2. Push Docker Images to Amazon ECR (Elastic Container Registry)**

#### **2.1. Create ECR Repositories**
- **Go to the Amazon ECR Dashboard**:
  - Navigate to **ECR** in the AWS Management Console.
  - Click on **Create Repository**.
  - Create a repository for both your frontend and backend containers.

#### **2.2. Build and Tag Docker Images**
- **Tag Your Docker Images**:
  - Use the ECR repository URI to tag your images.
  - Example:
    ```bash
    docker build -t your-frontend-repo-uri ./frontend
    docker build -t your-backend-repo-uri ./backend
    ```

#### **2.3. Authenticate Docker to ECR**
- **Login to ECR**:
  - Use the AWS CLI to authenticate Docker with your ECR registry:
    ```bash
    aws ecr get-login-password --region us-east-1 | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin your-account-id.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
    ```
  - Replace `us-east-1` and `your-account-id` with your actual AWS region and account ID.

#### **2.4. Push Images to ECR**
- **Push the Images**:
  - Push the tagged images to ECR:
    ```bash
    docker push your-frontend-repo-uri
    docker push your-backend-repo-uri
    ```

### **3. Deploy Using Amazon ECS (Elastic Container Service)**

#### **3.1. Create an ECS Cluster**
- **Go to the ECS Dashboard**:
  - Navigate to **ECS** in the AWS Management Console.
  - Click on **Create Cluster**.
  - Choose either **Fargate** for serverless containers or **EC2** for VM-based containers.
  - Configure your cluster with the desired VPC and subnets.

#### **3.2. Create Task Definitions**
- **Define a Task for the Frontend**:
  - Go to **Task Definitions** and click **Create new Task Definition**.
  - Choose Fargate or EC2, depending on your cluster.
  - Specify the container details, including:
    - **Container Name**
    - **Image URI** (from ECR)
    - **Port Mappings** (e.g., 3000:3000 for the frontend)
    - **Environment Variables** if needed
- **Define a Task for the Backend**:
  - Repeat the above steps for the backend container (e.g., 4000:4000).

#### **3.3. Create Services**
- **Go to Services**:
  - Click **Create Service**.
  - Choose your cluster and the task definition you just created.
  - Specify the number of desired tasks (containers) for high availability.
  - Configure service networking (e.g., VPC, subnets, security groups).
  - Repeat the process for both frontend and backend services.

### **4. Set Up Networking**

#### **4.1. VPC and Subnets**
- **Ensure Your Cluster is in a VPC**:
  - The cluster should be set up within a VPC with at least one public subnet for the frontend and one private subnet for the backend.
- **Create Security Groups**:
  - Set up security groups to control access to your services.
  - Allow HTTP/HTTPS traffic to the frontend.
  - Restrict backend traffic to only allow requests from the frontend service.

#### **4.2. Application Load Balancer (ALB)**
- **Set Up an ALB**:
  - Go to the EC2 dashboard and create an Application Load Balancer.
  - Configure listeners for HTTP (port 80) or HTTPS (port 443).
  - Set up target groups for your frontend and backend ECS services.
  - Configure routing rules to direct traffic to the appropriate service based on paths (e.g., `/api` for the backend).

### **5. Configure DNS with Route 53 (Optional)**
- **Set Up a Custom Domain Name**:
  - Go to the Route 53 dashboard and create a hosted zone for your domain.
  - Add an A record pointing to the ALB.
  - If you don't have a custom domain, you can use the ALB's DNS name.

### **6. Set Up CI/CD with AWS CodePipeline (Optional)**
- **Automate the Build and Deploy Process**:
  - Go to the AWS CodePipeline dashboard and create a new pipeline.
  - Add stages for:
    - **Source**: Connect to your GitHub or other source repository.
    - **Build**: Use AWS CodeBuild to build and push Docker images to ECR.
    - **Deploy**: Use AWS CodeDeploy to deploy the updated images to ECS.
  - Configure triggers to automatically deploy when you push changes to your source repository.

### **7. Monitor and Scale**

#### **7.1. Use CloudWatch**
- **Monitor ECS Services**:
  - Go to the CloudWatch dashboard to set up monitoring for your ECS services.
  - Track CPU, memory usage, and other metrics.
  - Set up alarms to notify you of issues.

#### **7.2. Set Up Auto-Scaling**
- **Auto-Scaling in ECS**:
  - Go to the ECS service and configure auto-scaling based on metrics like CPU utilization.
  - Set minimum and maximum task counts to ensure availability during traffic spikes.

### **8. Security Considerations**

#### **8.1. IAM Roles**
- **Assign IAM Roles**:
  - Use IAM roles to grant permissions to your ECS tasks.
  - Ensure that only the necessary permissions are given, following the principle of least privilege.

#### **8.2. Secrets Management**
- **Use AWS Secrets Manager or SSM Parameter Store**:
  - Store sensitive information such as API keys or database credentials.
  - Retrieve these secrets securely in your ECS tasks.

### **9. Test Your Deployment**
- **Access the Application**:
  - Use the DNS name provided by Route 53 or the public IP from the ALB.
  - Verify that both the frontend and backend are functioning correctly.
  - Test various endpoints and user interactions.

### **Summary**
This detailed process covers everything from Dockerizing your application to deploying it on AWS using ECS and ECR, with considerations for networking, security, and monitoring. Depending on your applicationâ€™s specific needs, you might need to adapt these steps, but this guide should provide a solid foundation for deploying a full-stack application on AWS.
