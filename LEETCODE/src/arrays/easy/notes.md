Great question!

Let’s analyze this line from your `push_left` function:

```python
for i in range(1, len(a)):
    a[i - 1] = a[i]
```

You're asking: **"Why can't we use `k = 0` and assign `a[k] = a[i]` instead of `a[i - 1] = a[i]`?"**

---

### 🔍 Let's break it down step by step:

#### 📌 The Goal:

To shift all elements **one step to the left**:

```python
Before: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
After:  [2, 3, 4, 5, None]
```

That means:

- `a[0] = a[1]`
- `a[1] = a[2]`
- `a[2] = a[3]`
- `a[3] = a[4]`

Then fill `a[4] = None`

---

### ✅ Why `a[i - 1] = a[i]` is correct:

Let’s look at iteration-wise values:

```python
for i in range(1, len(a)):   # i = 1 to 4
    a[i - 1] = a[i]
```

- i = 1 → a\[0] = a\[1]
- i = 2 → a\[1] = a\[2]
- i = 3 → a\[2] = a\[3]
- i = 4 → a\[3] = a\[4]

Perfect — you're shifting each element left.

---

### ❌ Why `k = 0; a[k] = a[i]` **won’t work as a loop**

If you tried this:

```python
k = 0
for i in range(1, len(a)):
    a[k] = a[i]
```

You're always assigning to `a[0]` on every iteration:

- i = 1 → a\[0] = a\[1]
- i = 2 → a\[0] = a\[2] ← overwrites again
- i = 3 → a\[0] = a\[3]
- i = 4 → a\[0] = a\[4]

So you’ll just keep overwriting `a[0]`, and all other elements remain unchanged.

✅ **You need `k` to move with `i`, and specifically lag behind by 1**, which is exactly what `a[i - 1] = a[i]` does.

---

### 🎯 If You Want to Use `k` Explicitly

Yes, you **can** use `k`, but then you'll need to increment it manually:

```python
def push_left(a):
    k = 0
    for i in range(1, len(a)):
        a[k] = a[i]
        k += 1
    a[-1] = None
    return a
```

This is functionally the same as `a[i - 1] = a[i]`.

### ✅ Conclusion

| Style                                    | Equivalent                                          |
| ---------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `a[i - 1] = a[i]`                        | Simple and idiomatic                                |
| `k = 0; a[k] = a[i]; k += 1`             | Also correct but longer                             |
| `k = 0; a[k] = a[i]` (without increment) | ❌ Incorrect — overwrites only one index repeatedly |

Let me know if you'd like a full dry-run using both approaches!
