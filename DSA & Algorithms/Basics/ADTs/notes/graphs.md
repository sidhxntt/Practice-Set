# Understanding Graphs: Types, Terminology & Real-World Applications

Graphs are one of the most powerful structures in computer science and mathematics. They help model relationships, solve optimization problems, analyze networks, and design algorithms used daily — in navigation systems, social networks, compilers, and networking.

This guide walks through essential graph types, key terminology, and practical use cases.

---

## What is a Graph?

A graph is represented as:

G = (V, E)

where:

- `V` = set of vertices (nodes)
- `E` = set of edges (connections)

Graphs can be directed or undirected, connected or disconnected, cyclic or acyclic, weighted or unweighted. Understanding these characteristics is essential to applying graph theory.

---

## 1. Non-Connected Graph

A non-connected graph contains multiple components; not all nodes are reachable from each other.

- **Connected component:** a set of nodes connected internally but not to other parts of the graph.
- **Articulation point:** a vertex whose removal increases the number of components — useful for finding network vulnerabilities.

Use cases:

- Network segmentation analysis
- Fault-tolerant system design
- Clustering in social networks

---

## 2. Self Loop & Parallel Edges

### Self Loop

A self loop is an edge where a node points to itself.

Use cases:

- Automata theory
- State machines (self-transitions)
- Modeling repetitive behaviors

### Parallel Edges

Parallel edges (multi-edges) are multiple edges connecting the same pair of vertices.

Use cases:

- Transportation networks (multiple roads between cities)
- Packet routing (multiple channels between routers)
- Biological multigraph models

### Degrees in Directed Graphs

- **In-degree:** number of incoming edges
- **Out-degree:** number of outgoing edges

Use case: algorithms like PageRank, social influence ranking, and dependency analysis rely on degrees.

---

## 3. Directed Graph (Digraph)

Edges have direction (arrows).

Use cases:

- Social networks (followers → following)
- Web link structure
- Task scheduling and workflows
- Recommendation systems

---

## 4. Strongly Connected Graph

A directed graph is strongly connected if every node can reach every other node via directed paths.

Use cases:

- Network robustness analysis
- Identifying tightly-knit groups in social networks
- Web crawling for tightly-linked clusters

---

## 5. Simple Directed Graph (Simple Digraph)

A digraph without self loops and without parallel edges. This is the typical graph model used in many algorithms.

Use cases:

- Shortest-path algorithms
- Dependency graphs
- Compiler internals

---

## 6. Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)

A DAG is a directed graph with no cycles (you cannot start at a node and return by following directed edges). DAGs are central to many applications.

Use cases:

- Task/job scheduling (dependencies)
- Topological sorting
- Git commit history
- Course prerequisite graphs
- Build systems (make, CI pipelines)

---

## 7. Topological Ordering

A topological ordering is a linear ordering of vertices in a DAG such that if there is an edge `u → v`, then `u` appears before `v`.

Use cases:

- Build systems and makefiles
- Course scheduling
- Instruction scheduling in CPUs
- Resolving package or module dependencies

---

## 8. Undirected Graph

Edges have no direction — they simply connect two nodes.

- **Degree of a node:** the number of edges incident to it.

Use cases:

- Social networks (mutual friendships)
- Road maps (two-way streets)
- Electrical circuit modeling
- Undirected clustering algorithms

---

## Summary

| Graph Type / Term | Meaning | Use Cases |
|---|---|---|
| Non-connected graph | Multiple separate components | Clustering, network segmentation |
| Articulation point | Vertex whose removal increases components | Fault detection |
| Self loop | Node connected to itself | Automata, state machines |
| Parallel edges | Multiple edges between same nodes | Routing, multigraphs |
| Directed graph | Edges have direction | Web links, workflows |
| Strongly connected | Every node reaches every other node | Robustness analysis |
| Simple digraph | No loops, no parallel edges | Algorithms, compilers |
| DAG | Directed graph with no cycles | Scheduling, version control |
| Topological ordering | Linear order respecting edge direction | Build pipelines, prerequisites |
| Undirected graph | Edges without direction | Social networks, maps |
