### ðŸ”¹ Python `list` (dynamic array)

* Backed by **contiguous memory**.
* Fast **random access** â†’ `mylist[i]` is **O(1)**.
* Appending at the end (amortized) is **O(1)**.
* But inserting/removing in the **middle or beginning** is **O(n)** (because everything has to shift).

---

### ðŸ”¹ Linked List

* Backed by **nodes** with pointers.
* No contiguous memory requirement.
* **Insertions/deletions** at the beginning or middle (if you already have a reference to the node) are **O(1)**.
* But **random access is slow** â†’ finding the `i`-th element requires **O(n)** traversal.

### âœ… So why use a linked list in Python?

* **Educational reasons** â†’ to understand data structures and how they work under the hood.
* **When you expect lots of insertions/deletions** in the middle or front of a sequence, and random access is not needed.
* **Memory flexibility** â†’ avoids resizing that Python lists do behind the scenes.
* **Custom structures** â†’ you can extend it (e.g., building stacks, queues, LRU caches, adjacency lists for graphs, etc.).
* In **low-level systems (like C)**, linked lists are more crucial because arrays have fixed size â€” but in Python, built-in lists already cover most needs.

ðŸ‘‰ In short:

* Use Pythonâ€™s `list` for **general purpose** â€” itâ€™s optimized and fast.
* Use a linked list mainly for **learning, special cases, or custom structures**.
