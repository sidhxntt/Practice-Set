### 1️⃣ Arrays as the **foundation**

* Arrays are **physical data structures**: a contiguous block of memory storing elements.
* Every element has a fixed memory address (or an offset), so **indexing is O(1)**.
* Because of this physical layout, operations like append, delete, or access are efficient in terms of memory.

---

### 2️⃣ Other linear data structures are **logical abstractions**

* **Stacks** and **Queues** are **abstract data types (ADTs)** that define *behavior*:

  * Stack → LIFO (Last In First Out)
  * Queue → FIFO (First In First Out)
* They **can be implemented using arrays** (or linked lists, or other structures).
* The *physical operations* often resemble array operations:

  * `delete_from_front` in array → `pop(0)` in Python list → dequeue in queue.
  * `delete_from_end` in array → `pop()` → pop in stack.

---

### 3️⃣ Key Idea

* **Abstract Data Type (ADT)** defines *what* the operations do.
* **Underlying physical structure** defines *how* they are stored in memory.
* Using pointers or indexes, the same memory operations can support different ADTs:

  * Example: Using an array with a `front` pointer gives a queue.
  * Using an array with a `top` pointer gives a stack.

---

### 4️⃣ Analogy

Think of it like this:

| ADT / Logical Structure | Underlying Physical Array Operation          |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Stack `push`            | Append to end of array (`array[size] = val`) |
| Stack `pop`             | Remove last element (`size -= 1`)            |
| Queue `enqueue`         | Append to end of array (`array[size] = val`) |
| Queue `dequeue`         | Remove first element (`shift elements left`) |

> So physically, the array is doing the same thing—just the abstraction layer interprets it differently.
