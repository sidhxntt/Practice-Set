### 🏠 **Program = Blueprint of a house**

- Just a **plan**—no physical structure yet.
- It describes **what goes where**: like "a lamp will go in this corner", "a sofa here", etc.
- No space is taken yet, just **instructions** on how to build the house and where to place everything.

---

### 🔄 **Process = Actual house being built**

- When you **run a program**, it becomes a **process**—just like the blueprint being used to **build a real house**.
- Now the furniture **does take up space** (RAM, CPU time, etc.).
- You can even build **multiple houses** (i.e., run the same program multiple times = multiple processes).

---

### 🧍‍♂️ **Thread = Person(s) arranging furniture**

- A thread is the **worker** doing the task. The **default thread** is like one person following the blueprint to arrange things.
- But you can have **multiple threads**—like several people working in parallel:
  - One arranging the bedroom
  - One setting up the kitchen
  - Another cleaning up

## Each thread shares the same house (process), but they can work **independently or together**, speeding things up.

## 💻 Code Analogy (Python-style)

```python
import threading

# Program (Blueprint)
def setup_living_room():
    print("Placing sofa and TV")

def setup_kitchen():
    print("Arranging utensils and fridge")

# Process (House in memory) starts when this runs
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Threads (people doing the work)
    t1 = threading.Thread(target=setup_living_room)
    t2 = threading.Thread(target=setup_kitchen)

    # Start the threads (people start arranging)
    t1.start()
    t2.start()

    # Wait for them to finish
    t1.join()
    t2.join()

    print("House setup complete!")
```

---

### **Code Example: Node.js**

#### **Program (Blueprint)**

The program is the code you write in a file before it starts running. For example:

```javascript
const http = require("http");

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  res.end("Hello, World!");
});

server.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log("Server running on port 3000");
});
```

This file is a **blueprint**. Nothing happens until you run it, e.g., by executing `node server.js`. At this point, the program transforms into a **process**.

---

#### **Process (Restaurant in Action)**

When you run `node server.js`, the operating system creates a **process** to execute the code. This process:

- Is a running instance of your program.
- Has its own allocated memory, CPU time, and resources.
- Operates independently of other processes. For instance, running multiple Node.js servers would create multiple independent processes.

##### Process Details:

- Managed by the operating system.
- Can be identified by a **Process ID (PID)**.
- Contains one or more threads (in Node.js, mostly a single thread due to its event loop model).

---

#### **Threads (Workers in the Restaurant)**

Within the process, tasks are executed as **threads**. In Node.js:

- **The Main Thread** is responsible for running your JavaScript code.
- **Worker Threads** (or the thread pool) are used for performing expensive operations like file I/O, cryptography, or networking tasks.

Here’s an example using Node.js’s **Worker Threads**:

```javascript
const { Worker, isMainThread, parentPort } = require("worker_threads");

if (isMainThread) {
  // This is the main thread (Process manager)
  console.log("Main thread: Spawning a worker...");

  const worker = new Worker(__filename);
  worker.on("message", (msg) => {
    console.log(`Message from worker: ${msg}`);
  });
  worker.postMessage("Start processing!");
} else {
  // This is the worker thread
  parentPort.on("message", (msg) => {
    console.log(`Worker received: ${msg}`);
    parentPort.postMessage("Processing complete!");
  });
}
```

---

### Relating to the Analogy

1. **Program**: The source file (e.g., `server.js`) is the restaurant's blueprint. It defines the logic but doesn't "run" yet.
2. **Process**: When you run `node server.js`, a restaurant (process) is opened. It starts running and has its own memory, CPU, and resources.

3. **Threads**:
   - The main thread is like the restaurant manager coordinating tasks.
   - Worker threads are like chefs or servers handling specific tasks concurrently (e.g., a chef baking pizza while another preps salad).

---

### Additional Code Demonstration

#### Single Process, Single Thread:

Node.js, by default, operates in a **single-threaded** model using the **Event Loop** to handle tasks like this:

```javascript
setTimeout(() => console.log("Task 1"), 1000);
setTimeout(() => console.log("Task 2"), 500);

console.log("Main thread running tasks...");
```

Here:

- The **main thread** runs `console.log`.
- The **event loop** schedules `Task 1` and `Task 2`.

#### Multi-Process Example:

Using **child processes** for heavier tasks:

```javascript
const { fork } = require("child_process");

const child = fork("heavyTask.js");

child.on("message", (msg) => {
  console.log(`Message from child process: ${msg}`);
});

child.send("Start heavy task");
```

Each **child process** is like opening a new restaurant branch. It operates independently of the parent process.

---

Let's break down **single-threaded**, **multi-threaded**, **processes**, and **child processes** using the same **restaurant analogy**, then connect it with corresponding **code** examples.

---

### **1. Single-Threaded Process (One Chef in a Restaurant)**

In a **single-threaded process**, there is only **one thread** (like a single chef in a restaurant). This chef is responsible for preparing all the dishes, one by one. If the chef is busy cooking one dish, the next order has to wait until the chef finishes.

#### **Restaurant Analogy (Single-Threaded)**:

- **One chef** does all the work (preparing all dishes, taking orders, serving).
- **One thread** (main thread) handles everything in the process.

#### **Code Example (Single-Threaded)**:

```javascript
console.log("Restaurant is opening...");

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("Chef is cooking dish 1...");
}, 2000);

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("Chef is cooking dish 2...");
}, 1000);

console.log("Chef is preparing orders...");
```

In the code:

- The **single-threaded event loop** handles all tasks sequentially.
- Even though we have two tasks (cooking dish 1 and dish 2), they are queued and executed one after the other, based on their timeouts.
- **Chef** (main thread) has to handle both cooking tasks, so one waits for the other to finish.

#### Key Points:

- One thread is handling everything.
- Even if multiple tasks are scheduled, they are executed sequentially.
- No real parallelism; only concurrency via the event loop.

---

### **2. Multi-Threaded Process (Multiple Chefs in a Restaurant)**

In a **multi-threaded process**, the restaurant has multiple **chefs** working on different tasks simultaneously. Each chef is a **separate thread** in the process, working concurrently on different orders.

#### **Restaurant Analogy (Multi-Threaded)**:

- **Multiple chefs** (threads) working on different tasks at the same time: one chef cooking, another preparing appetizers, and another serving.
- **Threads** work independently but share resources (kitchen, utensils).

#### **Code Example (Multi-Threaded with Worker Threads in Node.js)**:

```javascript
const { Worker, isMainThread, parentPort } = require("worker_threads");

if (isMainThread) {
  // Main thread
  console.log("Restaurant opened with multiple chefs...");

  const chef1 = new Worker(__filename);
  const chef2 = new Worker(__filename);

  chef1.on("message", (msg) => console.log(`Chef 1: ${msg}`));
  chef2.on("message", (msg) => console.log(`Chef 2: ${msg}`));

  chef1.postMessage("Cooking dish 1...");
  chef2.postMessage("Cooking dish 2...");
} else {
  // Worker (chef) thread
  parentPort.on("message", (msg) => {
    console.log(`Chef received order: ${msg}`);
    parentPort.postMessage(`Order completed: ${msg}`);
  });
}
```

In the code:

- The **main thread** acts like the restaurant manager and spawns **multiple chefs (threads)** using `Worker`.
- Each chef (worker thread) processes tasks independently.
- Both chefs are working in parallel, allowing for true concurrency.

#### Key Points:

- Multiple threads work independently on different tasks.
- Each thread can handle different orders simultaneously.
- Threads share the process's memory and resources (the kitchen).

---

### **3. Processes (Multiple Independent Restaurants)**

In a **multi-process model**, each restaurant (process) operates independently. They have their own chefs (threads), and even though they may follow the same blueprint (program), they are completely isolated from each other. If one restaurant closes, the other remains open.

#### **Restaurant Analogy (Processes)**:

- Each **restaurant** (process) has its own **kitchen** (memory), **chefs** (threads), and resources.
- If one restaurant (process) has a problem (e.g., fire in the kitchen), it doesn't affect the other.

#### **Code Example (Processes in Node.js)**:

```javascript
const { fork } = require("child_process");

// Main restaurant process
console.log("Main restaurant is open!");

const restaurant1 = fork("restaurant1.js");
const restaurant2 = fork("restaurant2.js");

// The child processes (restaurants) work independently
restaurant1.on("message", (msg) => console.log(`Restaurant 1: ${msg}`));
restaurant2.on("message", (msg) => console.log(`Restaurant 2: ${msg}`));

restaurant1.send("Order 1");
restaurant2.send("Order 2");
```

In this example:

- The **main process** spawns **two child processes** (representing two independent restaurants).
- Each child process can work independently, handling different tasks (orders).
- They don’t share memory; each process has its own allocated resources.

#### Key Points:

- **Processes** are isolated and independent.
- Each process has its own memory and resources.
- If one process crashes, it doesn't affect others.
- Multiple processes can be spawned to scale workloads (like opening multiple restaurants).

---

### **4. Child Processes (Sub-Branches of Restaurants)**

A **child process** is like opening a **sub-branch of the restaurant**. This child process is independent of the parent but still works under the same restaurant brand. The parent process can communicate with the child processes, passing orders and receiving updates.

#### **Restaurant Analogy (Child Process)**:

- A **parent restaurant** (main process) spawns **sub-branches** (child processes) to handle certain orders (tasks).
- The sub-branches can operate independently but report back to the main restaurant for coordination.

#### **Code Example (Child Process in Node.js)**:

```javascript
// parentProcess.js
const { fork } = require("child_process");
const child = fork("childProcess.js");

child.on("message", (msg) => {
  console.log(`Parent received message: ${msg}`);
});

child.send("Start cooking!");
```

```javascript
// childProcess.js
process.on("message", (msg) => {
  console.log(`Child received: ${msg}`);
  process.send("Cooking complete!");
});
```

In this example:

- The **parent process** (restaurant manager) communicates with a **child process** (sub-branch).
- The **child process** (sub-branch) does the work and sends updates back to the parent.
- **Parent-child communication** happens through messages.

#### Key Points:

- **Child processes** are like independent sub-branches of the main restaurant.
- They can work independently but communicate with the parent process.
- They have their own memory and resources.

| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Program**       | 🏗️ **Blueprint** of a house                                      | Just the plan—no construction or activity yet.                 |

---

## 👷 **1. Single-Threaded House (One Worker)**

- Only **one worker** doing all the tasks in the house: cooking, cleaning, painting, etc.
- Tasks are done **one at a time**, in sequence.

### 🧠 Tech Equivalent:

```python
name = input("Enter name:")  # Blocks the thread
print(f"Hello, {name}")
```

⛔ Blocking. Nobody else can work until this one task finishes.

---

## 👷👷 **2. Multi-Threaded House (Multiple Workers in the Same House)**

- Multiple workers do tasks **simultaneously** (e.g., one paints while another cooks).
- They share the same kitchen, tools, and rooms (shared memory).

### 🧠 Tech Equivalent:

```python
import threading
threading.Thread(target=task1).start()
threading.Thread(target=task2).start()
```

✅ Faster work. But workers must coordinate to avoid conflicts (e.g., both using the same drill).

---

## 🏠🏠 **3. Multiple Processes (Multiple Houses)**

- You have **separate houses**, each with its own workers, tools, and kitchens.
- A fire in one house (crash) doesn't affect the others.

### 🧠 Tech Equivalent:

```python
from multiprocessing import Process
Process(target=task).start()
```

✅ Completely isolated. 🧱 But harder to share info (need walkie-talkies = IPC).

---

## 🏠🏗️ **4. Child Process (Spawned House)**

- Your house starts building a **new house (child process)** next door to help out.
- They are **separate** but may send messages or materials back and forth.

### 🧠 Tech Equivalent:

```python
from subprocess import Popen
Popen(["python", "child_script.py"])
```

✅ Great for heavy lifting. 🔌 But communication setup takes effort.

---

# 🌐 **Event Loop: The House Scheduler**

Imagine you only have **1 worker in the house**, but they're super efficient because they **schedule tasks smartly**.

Instead of waiting at the sink for water to boil (blocking), the worker:

1. Starts boiling water
2. While waiting, goes and folds laundry
3. Then returns when water’s ready

This is how **JavaScript's Event Loop** or **Python's `asyncio`** works.

---

## 📜 **Understanding Synchronous vs Asynchronous Execution**

| Style            | Analogy                                      | Tech Effect                 |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| **Synchronous**  | 🧍 Worker waits at the sink till water boils | ⏳ Blocking. Wastes time.   |
| **Asynchronous** | 🏃 Worker sets timer and does other tasks    | ⏱️ Non-blocking. Efficient. |

---

## 🌀 **The Event Loop is Your House Manager**

- Keeps track of pending tasks: cooking, fixing the bulb, getting groceries.
- Ensures tasks are **scheduled** properly:
  - Microtasks (urgent chores like turning off the stove)
  - Macrotasks (scheduled jobs like laundry or watering plants)

---

## 🧵 **Python vs JavaScript Async Summary**

| Feature     | Python (`asyncio`)             | JavaScript                             |
| ----------- | ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| Threads     | Optional (`to_thread`) for I/O | Hidden from dev (Web APIs use threads) |
| Event Loop  | Explicit (`asyncio.run()`)     | Implicit (runs automatically)          |
| Syntax      | `async def` / `await`          | `async function` / `await`             |
| True Async? | Mostly for I/O-bound tasks     | Always non-blocking I/O                |

---

## 🧪 Example: Smart Worker in the House (Event Loop in Action)

### 🔍 Scenario:

1. Worker logs entry.
2. Schedules two tasks:
   - Boil water (macrotask)
   - Check mailbox (microtask)
3. Logs exit.

### 🔢 JavaScript Example

```js
console.log("Start");

setTimeout(() => console.log("Boil water"), 0); // Macrotask

Promise.resolve().then(() => console.log("Check mailbox")); // Microtask

console.log("End");
```

### 🧾 Output

```
Start
End
Check mailbox
Boil water
```

### 📌 Why?

- Main worker logs `"Start"` and `"End"` immediately.
- Microtask (`Promise.then`) is **urgent** and executed right after the main tasks.
- Macrotask (`setTimeout`) is handled after microtasks.

|-------------------------------|
| console.log("Start")         |
| console.log("End")           |
-----------------------------------
             ⬇
-----------------------------------
|   Microtask Queue (Urgent)      |
|-------------------------------|
| Promise.then → "Check mailbox" |
-----------------------------------
             ⬇
-----------------------------------
|   Macrotask Queue (Scheduled)   |
|-------------------------------|
| setTimeout → "Boil water"       |
-----------------------------------
```

---

## 🎓 Async/Await = Promise Sugar

```js
async function doTasks() {
  console.log("Start");

  await Promise.resolve(); // Microtask, await pauses until resolved

  console.log("After await");
}
doTasks();
console.log("End");
```

### Output:

```
Start
End
After await
```

🔍 `async/await` just makes **Promises easier to read**. It's still a Promise under the hood!

Want this turned into a visual PDF or slide deck? I can create that too!

1. So my program has 3 funcs 2nd one takes 5 mins to run for eg so now in event loop as its single threaded func 1 will be processed then func2 will be moved to queue and func 3 will be processed but as this is single threaded it will wait for func2 for 5 mins and then func2 will be joined to that main thread & processed, hence we will use async to tell func2 needs to be queued and await so that main thread waits for the async func. whereas in if func2 was also sync main thread would have been stopped for 5 mins and then func 3 would have run. Therfore no real parallelism
2. Whereas multithreading, as func2 will take 5 mins we will make a seperate thread for this func and main thread and this new thread will run at the same time.

so in my words for asybc main thread:
func1 runs after that func2 runs which takes 5 mins so we make it async by making sure func 2 returns promise at that very moment ie it execiute immediately by returning a promise, so the promise here acts like a placeholder for func2 which makes the main thread non blocking and immediately after func3 is executed. So now func2 gets executed in the task queue ie in background. and as soon it gets executed without an error then the promise is resolved and it goes in the callback queue as a callback waiting to be executed. and after 5 mins callback is called in the main thread and func2 output is shown.
