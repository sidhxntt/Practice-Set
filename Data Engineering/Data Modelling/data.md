- Data = raw facts
- Information = processed, meaningful data
- Metadata = information about data (like a label or tag that describes it).
- data types:
  - structured - Schema based ie could be stored in RDBMS (tables)
  - semi structured - half baked schema (logs, XML, JSON) [document DBs such as MongoDB can be used]
  - unstructure - No schema for eg images, audio etc, S3, HDFS etc can be used to store it.

DATA -> PROCESSING -> INFORMATION -> INSIGHTS -> DECISION MAKING
