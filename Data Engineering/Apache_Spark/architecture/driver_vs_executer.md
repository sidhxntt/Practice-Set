# üöÄ Driver vs Executor in Spark

When you run a Spark application, two main types of processes are involved:

---

## üîπ 1. **Driver**

üëâ Think of the **Driver** as the **brain / master chef** of your Spark job.

### Responsibilities:

1. **SparkSession creation** ‚Äì Entry point (`SparkSession` or `SparkContext`).
2. **Job scheduling** ‚Äì Converts your transformations & actions into a **DAG (logical plan)**.
3. **Stage division** ‚Äì Breaks DAG into **stages** (shuffle boundaries).
4. **Task scheduling** ‚Äì Assigns **tasks** (one per partition) to executors.
5. **Result collection** ‚Äì Collects results back from executors and delivers to you.

### Where it runs:

- Usually runs on your **local machine** (in local mode).
- In a **cluster**, the driver runs on a **cluster node** (not your laptop) and coordinates executors.

## üîπ 2. **Executor**

üëâ Executors are like the **kitchen stations / line cooks** actually doing the work.

### Responsibilities:

1. **Task execution** ‚Äì Runs tasks assigned by the Driver on data partitions.
   _E.g., one task may filter partition 1, another may count partition 2._
2. **Data storage** ‚Äì Keeps cached data in memory if you call `.cache()` or `.persist()`.
3. **Reports back** ‚Äì Sends results or status updates back to the Driver.

### Where it runs:

- On **worker nodes** of the cluster.
- Each executor is a JVM process, and inside it runs multiple **task threads**.

## üîπ Workflow (Driver ‚Üí Executor)

1. You write code:

   ```python
   df = spark.read.csv("data.csv", header=True, inferSchema=True)
   df_filtered = df.filter(df.age > 30)    # Transformation
   count = df_filtered.count()             # Action
   ```

2. Driver:

   - Builds DAG ‚Üí optimizes with Catalyst.
   - Splits DAG into **stages**.
   - Creates **tasks** (one per partition).
   - Sends tasks to executors.

3. Executors:

   - Run tasks (process partitions).
   - Shuffle data if needed (for groupBy/join).
   - Return partial results.

4. Driver:

   - Collects partial results.
   - Combines & shows final output.

## üîπ Simple Diagram

```
                Driver (Master brain)
      ----------------------------------------
      - Creates SparkSession
      - Builds DAG (jobs, stages, tasks)
      - Schedules tasks to executors
      - Collects final results
      ----------------------------------------

                   ‚á©  Assign tasks

    ------------------------------------------------
    |   Executor 1   |   Executor 2   |  Executor 3 |
    ------------------------------------------------
    | Run Task A     | Run Task B     | Run Task C  |
    | Work on data   | Work on data   | Work on data|
    | Cache results  | Cache results  | Cache results|
    ------------------------------------------------

                   ‚áß  Send results back
```

## üîπ Analogy (Chef & Kitchen üç≥)

- **Driver = Head Chef**

  - Decides recipe, breaks it into steps, assigns to cooks, and checks final dish.

- **Executors = Line Cooks**

  - Actually chop veggies, cook food, plate it.

- **Tasks = Cooking steps for each ingredient batch**.

## ‚úÖ Key Differences Table

| Aspect          | Driver                     | Executor                     |
| --------------- | -------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Role            | Coordinator (brain)        | Worker (hands-on execution)  |
| Runs on         | One node (driver node)     | Many nodes (worker nodes)    |
| Creates         | DAG, jobs, stages, tasks   | Executes tasks on partitions |
| Stores data     | No                         | Yes (cache/persist)          |
| Fault tolerance | Restarts tasks via lineage | Gets replaced if one fails   |
| Number per app  | 1                          | Many                         |

üëâ Without the **Driver**, Spark has no coordination.
üëâ Without **Executors**, no work is done.
Both are **mandatory** for every Spark application.
