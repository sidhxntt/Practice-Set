# ðŸ”¹ What is a DAG in Spark?

**DAG = Directed Acyclic Graph**

* **Directed:** Each edge has a direction (data flows from one operation to another).
* **Acyclic:** No loops; an operation cannot depend on itself.
* **Graph:** Nodes represent **RDD/DataFrame transformations**, edges represent **dependencies**.

In Spark, a **DAG is a logical representation of all transformations** you apply to your data **before any action is executed**.

---

## ðŸ”¹ How DAG Works in Spark

1. **Transformations are Lazy**

   * `map`, `filter`, `groupBy`, `join`, etc. donâ€™t execute immediately.
   * Spark builds a **DAG** that records **what operations need to be done**.

2. **Action Triggers DAG Execution**

   * When you call `count()`, `collect()`, `show()`, Spark takes the DAG, optimizes it, and executes it.

3. **Catalyst Optimizer**

   * For DataFrames & SQL, Spark uses the **Catalyst optimizer** to:

     * Push down filters
     * Combine operations
     * Reduce shuffles
   * The DAG reflects the **optimized execution plan**.

---

## ðŸ”¹ DAG â†’ Stages â†’ Tasks

The DAG helps Spark **split the job into stages**:

* **Narrow transformations** â†’ same stage
* **Wide transformations (shuffle required)** â†’ new stage (shuffle boundary)

Each stage is then **split into tasks**, one per partition, executed on **executors**.

## ðŸ”¹ Example: CSV + Filter + GroupBy

```python
df = spark.read.csv("people.csv", header=True, inferSchema=True)
df_filtered = df.filter(df.age > 30)
df_grouped = df_filtered.groupBy("city").count()
df_grouped.show()
```

### DAG Representation (Logical)

```
Read CSV
   â”‚
Filter age > 30
   â”‚
GroupBy city
   â”‚
Count
   â”‚
Action: show()
```

* **Edges** = data flow / dependency between transformations
* **Nodes** = operations on data
* **Action** triggers execution

---

### Physical DAG (After Catalyst Optimization)

```
Stage 1: Read CSV + Filter (narrow)
    â”œâ”€â”€ Task 1 â†’ Partition 1
    â”œâ”€â”€ Task 2 â†’ Partition 2
    â””â”€â”€ Task 3 â†’ Partition 3

Shuffle Boundary (GroupBy)
Stage 2: GroupBy + Count
    â”œâ”€â”€ Task 1 â†’ handles city A
    â”œâ”€â”€ Task 2 â†’ handles city B
    â””â”€â”€ Task 3 â†’ handles city C
```

---

## ðŸ”¹ Why DAGs Are Important

1. **Fault Tolerance**

   * Spark can recompute lost partitions using the DAG.

2. **Optimized Execution**

   * Catalyst uses DAG to minimize shuffles, push down filters, and optimize joins.

3. **Parallelism**

   * DAG shows **independent operations** that can run in parallel.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Analogy (Factory / Recipe)

* **DAG** = Full recipe with all steps in order
* **Node** = Individual step (chop, cook, mix)
* **Edge** = Dependency (you canâ€™t cook until veggies are chopped)
* **Stage** = Step group that can be executed in parallel
* **Task** = One worker handling one batch
* **Shuffle boundary** = Steps where ingredients need to be gathered from multiple stations

---

âœ… **Key takeaway:**

* A **DAG in Spark** is a **logical plan of transformations** that shows how data flows.
* Spark uses the DAG to **break jobs into stages and tasks**, optimize execution, and handle failures efficiently.
