## ðŸ”¹ What is a Spark Executor?

* An **Executor** is a **JVM process running on a worker node** in a Spark cluster.
* Its job: **execute tasks** and **store data** for the application.

Think of it as a **worker engine** that does the actual computation.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Responsibilities of an Executor

1. **Task Execution**

   * Receives tasks from the **Driver**.
   * Runs the transformations and actions on its **partitions**.

2. **Data Storage**

   * Keeps **RDD/DataFrame partitions** in memory or disk for **caching** or **shuffle** operations.

3. **Communication**

   * Sends **task results** back to the **Driver**.
   * Communicates with **other Executors** during shuffle (network transfer).

---

## ðŸ”¹ How Executors Work

1. **Driver submits a Job** â†’ Spark DAG is divided into **stages** â†’ stages into **tasks**.

2. **Tasks are scheduled on Executors** based on:

   * Number of partitions
   * Available cores per executor
   * Data locality

3. **Executor executes tasks** â†’ produces results â†’ returns partial results to Driver.

## ðŸ”¹ Executor vs Task

| Concept      | Definition                                              |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Executor** | JVM process on a worker node                            |
| **Task**     | Unit of work executed **by an executor** on a partition |
| **Stage**    | Group of tasks without shuffle                          |
| **Job**      | Action triggered execution                              |

---

## ðŸ”¹ Configuration

When submitting a Spark application, you can control executors:

```bash
spark-submit \
  --num-executors 4 \
  --executor-cores 4 \
  --executor-memory 8G \
  your_app.py
```

* `num-executors` â†’ Number of JVM processes
* `executor-cores` â†’ Parallel tasks per executor
* `executor-memory` â†’ Memory allocated to executor

---

## ðŸ”¹ Example (from CSV example)

```python
df = spark.read.csv("people.csv", header=True, inferSchema=True)
df_filtered = df.filter(df.age > 30)
df_filtered.groupBy("city").count().show()
```

* **Executor 1:** Handles Task 1 â†’ Partition 1
* **Executor 2:** Handles Task 2 â†’ Partition 2
* **Executor 3:** Handles Task 3 â†’ Partition 3
* During **shuffle** (groupBy), Executors exchange data as needed.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Analogy (Factory)

* **Driver** = Manager planning the work
* **Executor** = Factory worker
* **Task** = Small job assigned to a worker
* **Partition** = Portion of raw material worker handles

---

âœ… **Key takeaway:**

* Executors are **processes running on cluster nodes** that **do the actual work**.
* They execute **tasks**, store **data partitions**, and communicate with the **Driver**.
* Proper **executor configuration** is important for performance and resource utilization.
