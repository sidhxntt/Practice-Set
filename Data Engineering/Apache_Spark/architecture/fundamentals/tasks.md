## ðŸ”¹ What is a Spark Task?

* A **task** is the **smallest unit of work** in Spark.
* Each task **processes one partition of data**.
* Tasks are **executed by Executors** on worker nodes.
* Many tasks together form a **Stage**.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Key Points About Tasks

1. **One Task = One Partition**

   * If a stage has 8 partitions â†’ Spark will create 8 tasks.

2. **Task Execution**

   * Tasks run in **parallel** on executors (depending on the number of cores).
   * Each task reads its partition, applies transformations, and produces results.

3. **Task Lifecycle**

   * **Scheduled by Driver** â†’ Executor picks task â†’ executes â†’ result sent to Driver or stored locally.
   * If a task fails â†’ Driver can **retry the task** (fault tolerance).

4. **Task Types**

   * **ShuffleMapTask** â†’ Prepares data for shuffle (produces shuffle files)
   * **ResultTask** â†’ Computes final output for an action (like `count` or `collect`)

## ðŸ”¹ Example

```python
df = spark.read.csv("people.csv", header=True, inferSchema=True)
df_filtered = df.filter(df.age > 30)
df_filtered.groupBy("city").count().show()
```

* **Stage 1 (Read + Filter):**

  * Partition 1 â†’ Task 1
  * Partition 2 â†’ Task 2
  * Partition 3 â†’ Task 3

* **Stage 2 (GroupBy + Count / Shuffle):**

  * City A â†’ Task 1
  * City B â†’ Task 2
  * City C â†’ Task 3

---

## ðŸ”¹ Analogy (Cooking)

* **Stage** = a cooking step (e.g., chopping, mixing)
* **Task** = a chef handling **one portion of ingredients** (partition)
* **Executors** = kitchen stations executing tasks

---

âœ… **Key takeaway:**

* **Task = smallest unit of execution in Spark.**
* Each task works on **one partition**, runs in parallel, and contributes to the overall stage/job result.
