Ah, this is a really important distinction 👍 Let’s clear it up step by step.

## 🧠 What Distributed Computing Really Means

Distributed computing is a **general concept**:
👉 *“Breaking a big problem into smaller pieces and solving them across multiple computers that communicate over a network.”*

It is **not limited to data processing** — that’s just one (very popular) use case.

---

## 📊 Where Distributed Computing is Used

### 1. **Data Processing (the most famous one)**

* Frameworks like **Apache Spark, Hadoop, Flink**.
* Handle terabytes/petabytes of data.
* Example: Analyzing billions of web clicks for ad targeting.

---

### 2. **Application Architectures**

* **Microservices** = distributed computing for applications.
* Different services (auth, payments, notifications) live on different servers.
* Example: Amazon checkout flow calls 20+ microservices behind the scenes.

---

### 3. **Databases**

* **Distributed databases** (Cassandra, MongoDB, CockroachDB).
* Data is split across many machines for scalability and reliability.
* Example: Netflix stores shows metadata across thousands of nodes globally.

---

### 4. **Real-Time Systems**

* **Streaming & Messaging systems** (Kafka, Pulsar).
* Distribute event logs across clusters for high-throughput processing.
* Example: Uber processes GPS signals from millions of drivers.

---

### 5. **Scientific & High-Performance Computing (HPC)**

* Weather simulation, protein folding, physics simulations.
* Supercomputers with thousands of nodes.
* Example: NASA simulating Mars landings.

---

### 6. **Cloud Computing**

* AWS, Azure, GCP = distributed computing platforms.
* You rent compute, storage, networking resources across data centers worldwide.

---

## ✅ In Short

* **Distributed computing ≠ only data processing**.
* It’s a **general approach** that applies to:

  * Big data analytics (Spark, Hadoop).
  * App architectures (Microservices).
  * Databases, streaming systems, cloud, HPC.

👉 Data processing is just the most visible use case because that’s where distributed computing *became famous* in the big data era.
